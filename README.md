# Striver DSA Sheet Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the questions from the [Striver DSA Sheet](https://sachuverma.github.io/DataStructures-Algorithms/Striver%20Sheet/). The Striver DSA Sheet is a comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms problems curated by [Sanchit Verma](https://sachuverma.github.io), aimed at helping individuals prepare for technical interviews.


## Getting Started

To run the code locally, ensure you have a C++ compiler installed. You can compile and run each problem solution using the following commands:

```bash
g++ problem1.cpp -o problem1
./problem1
```
